# Contributing to v - Mobile IDE

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **v**! This project aims to create the future of mobile development, and we welcome contributions from developers who share this vision.

## üåä The Hyper Wave Philosophy

We're building something that doesn't exist yet‚Äîa truly mobile-native development environment. Every contribution, whether it's a bug fix, new feature, or documentation improvement, helps push the boundaries of what's possible in mobile development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK** (3.8.1 or later)
- **Dart SDK** (included with Flutter)
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code** with Flutter extensions
- **Git** for version control
- **A Linux server with SSH access** for testing (optional but recommended)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/willbarksdale/v.git
   cd v
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   flutter analyze
   ```

4. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Setting Up a Test SSH Server

For development and testing, you'll want access to a Linux server:

- **Local**: Use Docker or VirtualBox to run a Linux container/VM
- **Cloud**: Free tiers from Oracle Cloud, AWS, DigitalOcean, or Linode
- **Existing**: Any Linux server you have access to

Basic server requirements:
- SSH daemon running on port 22 (or custom port)
- User account with shell access
- Basic development tools (git, text editors)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow [Dart/Flutter style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart)
- Use `flutter analyze` to check for issues
- Format code with `dart format .`
- Keep functions focused and well-documented
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### State Management

- We use **Riverpod** for state management
- Create providers in logical groups (SSH, file operations, UI state)
- Use `StateProvider` for simple state, `StateNotifierProvider` for complex state
- Keep business logic separate from UI components

### Architecture Principles

- **Mobile-First**: Every feature should be optimized for touch interfaces
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Fast initial load, then enhance with more features
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of network issues and SSH disconnections
- **Privacy-First**: No data should leave the user's device except via their SSH connection

## üéØ How to Contribute

### 1. Bug Reports

Found a bug? Please create an issue with:

- **Clear description** of the problem
