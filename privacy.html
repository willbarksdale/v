    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 6, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to v; the Mobile Development Studio. ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>
    <p>Our App operates on a "Bring Your Own Server" (BYOS) model. This means that the App acts as a client to connect to your own server, and we do not collect or store your personal data, code, or any information from your server.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Given our BYOS model, we do not collect, store, or have access to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your source code, files, or any data stored on your server.</li>
        <li>Personal information you might handle within your development environment.</li>
        <li>Usage analytics, except for anonymous, aggregated crash reporting to help us improve the App's stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information We Do Collect</h2>
    <p>The only information the App stores locally on your device is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SSH Credentials:</strong> To facilitate easy connection to your server, the App stores your SSH credentials (hostname, username, and password/private key) securely in your device's local keychain. This information is stored only on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The SSH credentials you provide are used solely to establish a connection between the App and your server. We do not use this information for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not use any third-party services that would have access to your data. Any services you choose to run on your own server are subject to their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data because it resides on your server. You can manage, modify, or delete your data at any time by accessing your server directly.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
