# 🧪 Mobile Development Studio (BYOS)

## 🧠 Mission Statement

**Create the future. Code anywhere.**

This is a revolutionary mobile-first Flutter app that transforms your phone into a complete development environment. No desktop. No IDE. No computer needed.

The app connects to your self-hosted server (BYOS model) and provides a full development workflow — from multi-terminal command execution to real-time code editing and live app preview — all from a single, elegant mobile interface.

### 🌊 The Hyper Wave Vision

We're building toward a future where **development is truly mobile-native**:

- **Zero Desktop Dependency**: Your phone becomes your primary development machine
- **Fully Local Workflow**: Own your server, own your code, own your creative process
- **AI-Powered Development**: Integrated AI assistance for code generation and problem-solving
- **Real-Time Everything**: Live preview, instant feedback, seamless iteration
- **Mobile-First UX**: Designed for touch, optimized for flow, built for creators on the go

The ultimate goal: **Make traditional computers optional for software development.**
